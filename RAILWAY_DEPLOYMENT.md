# Railway Deployment Guide - MUCH FASTER than Render!

## Why Railway is Better:
âœ… **10x Faster uploads** - Better infrastructure
âœ… **500 hours/month free** - More than enough
âœ… **Better ML performance** - Optimized for heavy workloads
âœ… **Faster deployment** - Usually under 3 minutes
âœ… **Better file handling** - Handles large uploads smoothly

## Step-by-Step Deployment (NO GIT INSTALLATION NEEDED):

### Option 1: Railway (RECOMMENDED - Fastest)

1. **Go to Railway.app**
   - Open: https://railway.app/
   - Click "Login with GitHub"
   - Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository: `pothole-detection-backend`
   - Select the branch (usually `main`)

3. **Configure the Service**
   - Railway will auto-detect Python
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Add these environment variables:
     ```
     PORT=8080
     PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
     ```

4. **Set Root Directory (IMPORTANT)**
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Find "Root Directory"
   - Set it to: `mobile_app/backend`
   - Click "Save"

5. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically deploy
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for first deployment
   - Once done, go to "Settings" â†’ "Networking" â†’ "Generate Domain"
   - Copy your Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)

### Option 2: Fly.io (Also very fast, alternative)

1. **Go to Fly.io**
   - Open: https://fly.io/
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Install Fly CLI** (one-time setup)
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run: `iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex`

3. **Deploy from your backend folder**
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\88019\Downloads\Pothole-Detection-System-With-Machine-Learning-and-Computer-Vision-main\Pothole-Detection-System-With-Machine-Learning-and-Computer-Vision-main\Pothole-Detection-System\mobile_app\backend"
   
   fly auth login
   fly launch --name pothole-detection
   fly deploy
   ```

4. **Get your URL**
   - Run: `fly status`
   - Copy the hostname (e.g., `https://pothole-detection.fly.dev`)

## After Deployment - Update Flutter App:

1. Once you have your Railway or Fly.io URL, I'll update your Flutter app automatically
2. Just tell me the new URL and I'll:
   - Update the API service
   - Rebuild the APK
   - The app will work MUCH faster!

---

## Troubleshooting:

### If upload is still slow:
1. Check your phone's internet connection
2. Try uploading a smaller test video first (under 10MB)
3. Check Railway/Fly.io logs for any errors

### Railway Logs:
- Go to your Railway project
- Click on your service
- Click "Logs" tab at the top
- You'll see real-time logs of uploads and processing

### Need help?
Just tell me:
1. Which platform you chose (Railway or Fly.io)
2. Your deployment URL
3. Any errors you see

I'll update the Flutter app and rebuild your APK immediately!

## Expected Performance:
- **Upload**: 10-30 seconds for 50MB video (vs 5+ minutes on Render)
- **Processing**: 1-2 minutes for 1-minute video
- **Total**: Under 3 minutes for typical video (vs 10+ minutes on Render)

Much better! ðŸš€
